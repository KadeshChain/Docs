## GENERAL INFORMATION
<h2>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
The presentation made here is about the market release of KADESH ECOSYSTEM TOKEN (KDS). KDS is a crypto token asset that will be used by KADESH ECOSYSTEM in all projects planned to be made available to end-users. KDS is also intended to be a crypto token that can be used to make commercial payments for a variety of services provided by businesses operating in various fields. KADESH will support the work of organizations that want to use KDS in their commercial activities and will generally not limit such use. KDS is not intended to constitute securities in any jurisdiction. The statements made here are not intended to be investment advice. Acquiring, buying and, selling decisions regarding KDS are the responsibility of the individual. It is the individual's responsibility to conduct the necessary research into the risks and potential losses or gains associated with these transactions. KADESH is not liable for any damages or losses that may be incurred.

## WHO CAN PURCHASE KDS?
<h2>WHO CAN PURCHASE KDS?</h2>
You are not eligible to purchase KDS if you are a citizen or resident of a country where the trading of crypto tokens is or may be prohibited by law. If you do not comply with the law, you will be responsible for the legal and financial consequences. Only individuals with sufficient knowledge and experience in crypto and blockchain systems, or businesses specializing in this field, should purchase KDS. Buyers should be knowledgeable of the storage, deposit, and withdrawal processes associated with crypto tokens. Any entities of KADESH, and their officers and employees will not be responsible in any way for the wrong actions and loss of any crypto tokens, KDS or, fiat currency, resulting from actions taken by, or omissions of the purchasers, and the loss of value that may occur in KDS. It is not advised to purchase KDS or participate in the KDS pre-sale unless you have sufficient knowledge and experience in the crypto market. It is recommended that you carefully analyze the potential risks and capital losses that may occur in the event of a KDS purchase and conduct the necessary research on this matter. If you are unable to make such assessments, it is critical that you do not purchase KDS until you have gained sufficient knowledge and experience.

## RISKS
<h2>RISKS</h2>
The following situations should be carefully considered before making a KDS investment. It is critical that you consult with a lawyer, accountant, tax professional and/or crypto experts about these situations and invest accordingly.

<span class="spn">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>KDS will be stored in a wallet that can only be accessed
with a password chosen by the purchaser. If a KDS purchaser
does not keep an accurate record of their password or forgets
it, this may lead to the loss of KDS as the wallet cannot be accessed. If the created password is weak and it is cracked by
somebody else or shared with third parties, this may also lead
to the loss of KDS. For these reasons, buyers must create
strong passwords and store them in a secure location that is
not accessible to others, as well as in one or more backup locations.

<span class="spn">(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By purchasing KDS, the purchaser understands that
some of the services provided by the KADESH are still in development and may undergo significant changes before they
are released

<span class="spn">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While KADESH will make every effort to connect the
KADESH ECOSYSTEM to the majority of the major crypto
exchanges in the crypto market, some exchanges may refuse
to connect with the KADESH ECOSYSTEM, resulting in less
liquidity being provided through the KADESH ECOSYSTEM
than expected in this paper.

<span class="spn">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While KADESH will make every effort to release the
KADESH ECOSYSTEM on time, the purchaser understands
that the official release of the KADESH ECOSYSTEM may be
delayed.

<span class="spn">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The buyer understands that, like other crypto tokens, the
value of KDS may fluctuate significantly and fall in value for a
variety of reasons, including but not limited to supply and
demand balance, positive or negative crypto token market
conditions, legal, political or geographical reasons, the global
economy, regulatory changes in any jurisdiction, and technical reasons.

<span class="spn">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>KDS is designed to run on the Kadesh Cahin Network (KDS).
As such, adverse events (such as network failures or maintenance) on the Kadesh Cahin Network may cause KDS transfer or
trading to be disrupted. Such incidents are not the responsibility of KDS.

## DISCLAIMER
<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
To the greatest extent permitted by applicable laws, regulations, and rules, KDS, any entities of KADESH, and their officers and employees shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or other losses of any kind, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise (including, but not limited to, revenue, income, or profit loss, as well as loss of use or data), arising from or in connection with any acceptance or reliance on this paper or any part of it. Any entities of KADESH, and their officers and employees shall not be liable for your loss of KDS after it has been transferred to you for any reason, including but not limited to, your failure to maintain or backup your password or password cracking by someone due to your poor password maintenance.

KADESH will do its best to launch its operations and develop KADESH ECOSYSTEM. Any person buying KDS acknowledges and understands that KADESH makes no warranty regarding the release of the KADESH ECOSYSTEM. As a result, they acknowledge and understand that KADESH (including its bodies and employees) accepts no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from or related to the inability to use the KDS.

Regulatory authorities around the world are closely scrutinizing businesses and operations involving crypto tokens. In this regard, regulatory measures, investigations, or actions may have an impact on KADESH’s business, limiting or prohibiting it from expanding its operations in the future. Individuals considering buying KDS should be aware that KADESH's business model or KADESH ECOSYSTEM, as well as its existing platforms, may change or need to be modified due to new regulatory and compliance requirements imposed by any applicable laws in any jurisdiction. In such cases, purchasers and anyone seeking to acquire KDS acknowledge and understand that neither KADESH nor any of its affiliates will be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damages resulting from such changes.
