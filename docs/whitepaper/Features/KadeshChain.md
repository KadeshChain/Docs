## Kadesh Chain
<h1>Kadesh Chain</h1>

The Kadesh Chain network will be used for all transactions in the Kadesh ecosystem. Data sent to the Kadesh Chain network is saved in blockchain databases that cannot be changed or exported. Users are hosted in these systems with their assigned ID. System security is provided by distributed database architecture. Furthermore, transactions between two Kadesh Wallet users are encrypted using the secure Kadesh algorithm, and the transaction ID is generated based on this data. The keys required for re-encryption and decryption of this transaction ID using the Kadesh security algorithm will be saved on numerous different databases throughout the distributed database architecture. Thus, the Kadesh ecosystem offers its users a secure network infrastructure that cannot be accessed from the outside, hacked, or tampered with.
