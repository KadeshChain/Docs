<h1>Kadesh Box</h1>

Kadesh Box service is a lockbox service, which seeks to make confidential documents and transactions customized to individuals or organizations using four-layer security and a two-layer encryption system. This system allows multi-partner firms, institutions, organizations, or individuals to store their data in a multi-user account which will be active only when all users of the account enter their security keys. Transactions on this system can be carried out in two stages; First, multiple users enter their encrypted keys, which are kept in decentralized systems, and then all users activate the transaction with their public keys.
