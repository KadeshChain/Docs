## What We Need
<h1>What We Need?</h1>


The financial freedom provided by the blockchain ecosystem is unfortunately accompanied by significant trust issues. While there are some well-intentioned individuals and groups that believe in financial freedom and invest and work for it, there are some individuals and groups that use the financial freedom promised by the blockchain ecosystem for fraud and fraudulent activities, and see data and situations requiring personal privacy as big data treasures to exploit. It is anticipated that the confusion and abuses caused by such malicious institutions and organizations will cause much greater damage to the blockchain ecosystem, which is still in its infancy, in the future, and, more importantly, trust issues.

Kadesh was created by a team that believes in financial freedom and the blockchain ecosystem, who had come together to prevent fraudulent activities that are increasing and eroding trust in the blockchain ecosystem.

By storing basic user data and mutual business agreements in a closed-loop blockchain infrastructure, Kadesh ecosystem seeks to enable individuals and businesses to create reliable smart business contracts over long distances conveniently and without intermediaries. Kadesh ecosystem users can use biometric data to digitally sign undertakings, wills, and mutual commercial contracts.

Kadesh also seeks to ensure that users can bequeath their Crypto assets and their wallets containing these Crypto assets, without compromising their financial freedom and personal privacy, to any third person or institution that they pre-determined without any bureaucratic obstacles or transactions.
