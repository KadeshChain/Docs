## Introduction

Throughout history, the Middle East has been the place where the oldest contracts in the world were made. In this regard, especially Mesopotamia, the region in the eastern Mediterranean near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that is sometimes referred to as "the cradle of civilization," plays an important role. The topics of the contracts made in this region were as varied as the human relationships themselves. The main ones were Sales and Purchase contracts whether for a land, crop, or a house, service contracts such as for repair of a house, Rental contracts even one with a 60-year term, Labor contracts such as for a ring with 20 years guarantee, Partnership contracts, Loan and end even Mortgage-like contracts, Marriage contracts with camels as dowry, Inheritance and of course afterwar Peace treaties.

The Kadesh project was born again in Mesopotamia with the awareness of preserving the continuity of history. The goal this time was to create the world's first blockchain-based digital contracts, which would be signed using the biometric data of the parties. The project got its name not from any ordinary commercial contract, but from the Treaty of Kadesh which is the earliest written peace contract still in existence. Also, considering how desperately we need it today, we thought that a name, reminding people of peace once again would be appropriate. Moreover, as the Treaty of Kadesh brought an end to centuries of conflict between the Hittite Empire and the Egyptians along the eastern Mediterranean, the Kadesh project emerged with the aim of bringing perpetual peace to the world of smart contracts.

As it is known that although the use of smart contracts on the blockchain, has become widespread since they first emerged, they have not yet gained legal and binding contract status. The reason for this is that smart contracts are based on the trustless trust principle, which states that the parties to the smart contract do not need to know or trust each other. In this regard, the Kadesh project seeks to combine the KYC protocol and the smart contract system, allowing smart contracts to be signed with biometric data and thus become legally binding.
