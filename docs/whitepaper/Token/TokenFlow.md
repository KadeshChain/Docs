## Collateral Pool
<h2>Collateral Pool</h2>
The user who wants to use the listing service must stake the amount of KDS tokens specified in the contract as collateral until the service contract is mutually terminated on Kadesh Wallet. (The amount of KDS tokens to be staked varies by service, and the amount of KDS tokens to be deposited as collateral and the collateral period vary depending on the average business volume and membership period.)

## Staking Pool
<h2>Staking Pool</h2>
Users who want to benefit from the features and services offered by Kadesh have to pay the related service plan payments in KDS over the specified amount. Example: A user who wants to benefit from Personal/Freelancer plan in the table above must stake $10 as KDS for a period of 30 Days. Companies and organizations, on the other hand, have to pay the specified $5 per user as KDS as specified in the Business plan.

## Kadesh Treasury Pool
<h2>Kadesh Treasury Pool</h2>
Commissions are deducted from the total amount and payment ratio of the sides determined by the users at the time of contract signing. For instance, for the payments in KDS, only the buyer pays 5%, only the seller pays 5%, or both the buyer and the seller pay 2.5% each.
